Total amount of computer memory required by an algorithm to complete its execution is called as space complexity of that algorithm.
If the amount of space required by an algorithm is increased with the increase of input value, then that space complexity is said to be Linear Space Complexity.
The time complexity of an algorithm is the total amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its execution.
